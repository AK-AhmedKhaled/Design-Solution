# DESIGN a function called area that consumes the length of one side
# of a square and produces the area of the square.

# length is Number    # Type Comment

# Number (0, infin) represents the length of one side of a square  # Interpretation

# Data Examples
l1 = 0
l2 = 2.5
l3 = 4

# # Data Driven Template
# def fn_for_length(l):
#     if (type(l) in [int, float] && l > 0):
#         return (...l)
# Template Rules used:
    # - atomic non-distinct: Integer
# /* it is optionally to add guards type(l) in [int, float] && l > 0 , see debugging and testing section*/
